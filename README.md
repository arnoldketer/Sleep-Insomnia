# Sleep health and lifestyle
This synthetic dataset contains sleep and cardiovascular metrics as well as lifestyle factors of 400 fictive persons.

The workspace is set up with one CSV file, sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv, with the following columns:

* Person ID
* Gender
* Age
* Occupation
* Sleep Duration: Average number of hours of sleep per day
* Quality of Sleep: A subjective rating on a 1-10 scale
* Physical Activity Level: Average number of minutes the person engages in physical activity daily
* Stress Level: A subjective rating on a 1-10 scale
* BMI Category
* Blood Pressure: Indicated as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure
* Heart Rate: In beats per minute
* Daily Steps
* Sleep Disorder: One of None, Insomnia or Sleep Apnea
  ## My guiding questions
1. Which factors could contribute to a sleep disorder?
2. Does an increased physical activity level result in a better quality of sleep?
3. Does the presence of a sleep disorder affect the subjective sleep quality metric?
